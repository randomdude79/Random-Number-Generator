# Random Number Generator MAX
![logo](/noncode/logo.png)

## IMPORTANT!!! This program is no longer getting updates as I have designed a better version [here.](https://github.com/randomdude79/RNG-Lite)
## The GitHub Repo will stay up so that you can still keep the newest version.
This Python program generates random numbers based on user input. It allows users to specify a range of numbers and the number of random numbers to generate. The program also supports the use of a seed for deterministic random number generation.

## Features

- Generates random numbers within a specified range.
- Supports the use of a seed for deterministic results.
- Handles user input validation to ensure that only integers are accepted.
- Detects and filters profanity in user email and feedback inputs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run the program using `python main.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate random numbers.

## Usage

- You will then be asked if you want to use a seed for random number generation.
- Next, you will be prompted to choose a range of numbers (minimum and maximum) and the number of random numbers to generate.
- The program will generate the random numbers and display them on the screen.
- You can also choose to find the average of the generated numbers and copy the seed used for generation.

## Contributions

- Contributions to the program are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
